# Welcome to the SMA Endpoint Directory

![CMS Logo](CMS.png)

The SMA Endpoint Directory was created to enhance interoperability by allowing State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) and application developers access to the Provider Directory and Patient Access API endpoints and integrate the endpoints into software products allowing patients to access their data.  An Endpoint Directory is a centralized repository that publishes information about API endpoints. This simplifies how healthcare organizations and third-party apps find and utilize endpoint information. This SMA Endpoint Directory will enable compliance with the Patient Access and Interoperability Final Rule. This directory also contain pointers to the detailed information required to access the endpoints.
